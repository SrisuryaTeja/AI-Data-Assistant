# AI Assistant for Data Science

## Overview

This project aims to build an AI Assistant designed to make your data science life easier. By leveraging Streamlit, LangChain, and open source models, the assistant will help users streamline the entire process of a data science project, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, and prediction. This tool is intended to save valuable time and resources, making data science more accessible and efficient.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Automatically generate insights and visualizations from your dataset.
- **Model Selection:** Get recommendations for the best machine learning models based on your data and project requirements.
- **Prediction:** Make predictions using trained models with user-friendly interfaces.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.
- **Integrations:** Utilizes LangChain for managing data and Open source models for intelligent assistance.
